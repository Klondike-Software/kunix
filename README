# Kunix
Clean, Stable, Open.

## What is Kunix?
Kunix is a open-source operating system based on xv6, released by the Klondike Software Project.

Kunix (Klondike Unix) is licensed under the K2-Standard License, and transitioning from the MIT license, which will be removed after a full rewrite.

To build kunix on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
